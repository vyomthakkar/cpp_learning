What I’d add (surgical upgrades for a quant SWE)

C++23 touches where helpful: consider swapping “expected-like” with std::expected if your toolchain supports it; also peek at std::mdspan for numeric arrays and std::print for fast logging. (Keep C++20 as baseline as your plan states.)

Coroutines (selective): a 1–2 day detour after W8 to prototype coroutine-based async I/O (e.g., asio), useful for feed handlers without thread explosion.

SIMD & allocators: one kata bucket on std::simd/intrinsics for hot loops; experiment with pmr allocators and arena allocators for predictable latency.

Linux perf hygiene: short module on CPU pinning/NUMA basics, page-fault avoidance, perf/vtune/perfetto usage, and cache-aware layout (complements W9).

Packaging & repo shape: use vcpkg/Conan for third-party libs; enforce a mono-repo skeleton (src/include/tests/bench/tools) with pre-commit hooks and CI—pairs perfectly with your “release a small lib” goal.

Networking & time: tiny NTP/PTP primer and timestamp discipline (system vs steady clocks) to avoid clock drift bugs in market-data timestamps.

Design reviews: add a weekly 15-min “design note” habit (one page: goal, constraints, alternatives, decision) for the week’s project—this compounds senior-engineer skills fast.
