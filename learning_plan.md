Awesome goal—and totally doable. Here’s a focused, modern C++ plan designed for daily practice and for the realities of low-latency/quant work. It’s structured, but lightweight enough to fit a busy schedule.

# How to use this plan

* **Baseline**: 60–90 mins on weekdays, 2–3 hrs on one weekend day.
* **Cadence**: Mon–Thu learn + kata, Fri tooling/tests, Sat mini-project, Sun light review/rest.
* **Tooling**: C++20 as default (peek at C++23 when helpful), GCC/Clang, CMake, clang-tidy, ASan/UBSan/TSan, GoogleTest, Google Benchmark.

# Week 0 (setup & refresh)

* **Environment**: Compiler (GCC/Clang), CMake, debugger (lldb/gdb), clang-tidy, sanitizers, GoogleTest, Google Benchmark.
* **Refresh**: basic syntax, build/run, headers vs translation units, namespaces, `auto`, range-for, `constexpr`, `enum class`.
* **Kata**: FizzBuzz variants → property-based tests (think: “numbers divisible by … always yield …”).

# 12-Week Fundamentals Plan

## Week 1 — Value types, references, RAII

* **Topics**: stack vs heap, copy vs reference, RAII, constructors/destructors, rule of 0/3/5.
* **Drills**: implement a small RAII wrapper for a `FILE*` or socket stub.
* **Kata ideas**: Unique ownership wrapper; small string builder; CSV row parser.
* **Project**: Write a tiny “resource tracker” that logs acquire/release with RAII.

## Week 2 — Smart pointers & lifetimes

* **Topics**: `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`, custom deleters, ownership graphs.
* **Drills**: convert raw-new code to smart pointers; detect and fix cycles.
* **Kata**: LRU cache with `list` + `unordered_map` (owning vs non-owning references).
* **Project**: Object pool with RAII handles.

## Week 3 — Move semantics & value categories

* **Topics**: rvalue/lvalue, move ctor/assign, `std::move`, `std::forward`.
* **Drills**: add move support to LRU; benchmark copy vs move.
* **Kata**: Small vector (SSO) or arena allocator (toy).
* **Project**: Build a `Buffer` type that avoids reallocations; microbench it.

## Week 4 — Error handling & contracts

* **Topics**: exceptions vs status codes, `std::expected` style patterns, invariants, assertions.
* **Drills**: refactor earlier code to use `expected`-like result (or `tl::expected` if allowed).

* **Project**: Config loader with validation + tests.

## Week 5 — The STL algorithms mindset

* **Topics**: containers, iterators, algorithm families, projections, iterator invalidation.

* **Kata**: Sliding window stats (min/max/mean) over streams using algorithms.
* **Project**: Time-series utilities library (resample, rolling stats) with tests.

## Week 6 — Templates, overload sets, type deduction

* **Topics**: function/class templates, deduction guides, `auto`/`decltype`, `constexpr` functions.
* **Drills**: write generic utilities; constrain with `requires` (C++20 concepts).
* **Kata**: Type-safe `strong_typedef` (e.g., Price vs Quantity); compile-time units.
* **Project**: Generic ring buffer; test with multiple types.

## Week 7 — Concepts, SFINAE → constraints

* **Topics**: designing APIs with concepts, customization points, ADL pitfalls.
* **Drills**: retrofit concepts into Week 6 code.
* **Kata**: `print_range` constrained to ranges; detect hashable types.
* **Project**: Mini serialization that works for any “range of trivially copyable T”.

## Week 8 — Concurrency basics

* **Topics**: threads, futures, mutexes, atomics, memory orders (at least `seq_cst`, `acq_rel`, `relaxed`), false sharing.
* **Drills**: parallelize rolling stats; measure contention.
* **Kata**: Producer/consumer queue (mutexed first).
* **Project**: Threaded market-data fan-out (stubbed data) with backpressure.

## Week 9 — Lock-free & low-latency techniques

* **Topics**: lock-free queues, ring buffers, cache lines, `alignas`, `std::atomic<T>`, ABA problem basics.
* **Drills**: single-producer single-consumer queue; benchmark vs mutexed.
* **Kata**: Wait-free tick counter; bounded MPMC ring buffer (stretch).
* **Project**: Tick aggregator that ingests millions of events/sec (synthetic), reports p50/p99 latency.

## Week 10 — Ranges, views, and formatting

* **Topics**: `std::ranges`, views pipelines, `fmt`/`std::format`, `std::string_view`.
* **Drills**: rewrite algorithms with ranges; avoid copies using views.
* **Kata**: Log filtering pipeline using views.
* **Project**: Query DSL over in-memory ticks using ranges.

## Week 11 — Files, time, and numerics

* **Topics**: `chrono` (nanosecond precision), steady vs system clock, `<random>`, `<numbers>`, I/O performance.
* **Drills**: seeded PRNG utilities; efficient binary I/O.
* **Kata**: Monte-Carlo π; Box–Muller RNG; Welford variance on streams.
* **Project**: Monte-Carlo pricer for a vanilla option; benchmark paths/sec.

## Week 12 — Testing, profiling, hardening

* **Topics**: GoogleTest, property tests, fuzzing, sanitizers, clang-tidy, perf counters, microbench.
* **Drills**: add benchmarks to earlier components; fix sanitizer findings.
* **Kata**: Fuzzer harness for your parsers.
* **Project**: “Release” a small library (docs, CI script, benchmarks, tests).

# Daily Micro-Routine (30–60 min)

1. **10–20 min**: read/recall (notes, one STL algorithm/concept).
2. **20–30 min**: 1–2 katas (see below), always with tests.
3. **10 min**: hygiene—run sanitizers/clang-tidy; jot a 3-line log: *what I learned, what broke, next step*.

# Kata Banks (pick 1–2 per day)

**Memory & Ownership**

* Implement `unique_resource<T>`; forbid copy, allow move.
* Shared graph with `weak_ptr` to break cycles.
* Small object optimization string (fixed buffer 32B).

**Algorithms & Ranges**

* Deduplicate sorted stream in place.
* Top-K by heap; streaming median with two heaps.
* Group-by and aggregate with ranges views.

**Parsing & Serialization**

* Fast CSV reader (no regex) with `string_view`.
* FIX-like tag=value parser (subset).
* Binary tick record (struct) read/write.

**Concurrency**

* SPSC ring buffer; then MPSC variant.
* Work-stealing task queue (basic).
* Lock-free counter with `fetch_add` relaxed vs acq_rel; measure.

**Numerics**

* Ziggurat normal sampler or Box–Muller.
* Rolling correlation of two streams.

* `strong_typedef` with arithmetic only when types match.
* `result<T,E>` minimal clone (like `expected`).
* Concept-constrained `to_string` via ADL.

**Robustness**

* Property tests: your CSV/FIX parsers never crash on random bytes.
* Fuzz a ring buffer API; detect UB with sanitizers.

# Quant-Flavored Mini-Projects (1 per week after Week 4)

* **Backtester Core**: event loop + strategy interface; PnL, drawdown, slippage models.
* **Metrics Daemon**: lock-free counters + periodic snapshotter; Prometheus text output.

# Reading/Reference (sprinkle in 10–15 min slots)

* *A Tour of C++ (3rd ed.)* for breadth.
* *Effective Modern C++* for habits.
* C++ Core Guidelines (lifetime/ownership).
* cppreference (daily driver).

---

# Tooling Habits (Fridays)

* Run **ASan/UBSan/TSan** on the week’s code.
* **clang-tidy** with a strict profile; fix or document warnings.
* **Benchmarks**: lock in a baseline for core data structures.
* One “red team” session: try to crash or corrupt your code.

# Checkpoints

* **Week 4**: you can explain RAII, moves, and show a working LRU cache with tests.
* **Week 8**: you can write a correct producer/consumer and debug races with TSan.
* **Week 12**: you can profile, fix sanitizer issues, and publish a small polished lib.

If you want, I can turn this into a printable tracker or set up daily reminders. Next step, I can also spin up a **30-day kata calendar** tailored to your time budget and give you a starter repo layout (CMake + tests + benchmarks) so you’re coding on Day 1.
